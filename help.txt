this is the master setup repository for all the projects
to set up one or more projects do the following:

1. create a master folder that will contain all the projects
2. clone https://github.com/davidsi/configure.git to a sub folder called "configure"
3. make sure you have export DMS-ROOT=~/github set!
4. change the attribs of ./configure/setup.sh to be an executable
5. run ./configure/setup.sh from the top folder with the following parameters for the projects:

'chippy-soc'   : complete chippy ruxpin project
'boat-all'     : all arduino, hardware, ios and node repositories for the boat controller
'weather-all'  : node and arduino files for weather station 
'weather-soc'  : just node (chip)  files for weather station 
'all-arduino'  : all the arduino repositories
'all'          : everything

for bringing up chip divices to wifi, us the apfd.service file in the config folder

typically repositories are 
	XXX-lib     : the library for the language
	XXX-arduino	: all the arduino code for the project as they tend to be built on the laptop
	XXX         : node code for SOC devices that only require their own code
                : should name these XXX-node

the repositories are used as follows:
	'arduino-lib'     : arduino library functions
	'boat-arduino'    : all arduino projects for the boat controller
	'boat-devices'    : devices (node) running on a laptop, or base code such as nodeBaseServer that can be copied
	'boat-ios'        : ios controller for boat controller
	'boat-server'     : the server for the boat, connects all devices, iOS, iKommunicate etc
	'chippy'		  : chippy ruxpin node code
	'configure'       : master setup
	'gmail-example'   : for creating apps transmitting by mail, such as the qcyc fleet captain app
	'hardware'        : 3d print and scematics
	'node-lib'		  : node library
	'rov-arduino'     : arduino section of the rov
	'rov-node'		  : node section of ROV - includes both controller and sub
	'weather-station' : the chip (node) code for the weather device

the following are archived
	chip-controller
	development     : this is the archive

each repository has an optional configure.sh file which will be run when it is set up. In the case of the node based repo's, it will contain the list of NPM modules required.
