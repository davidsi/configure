this is the master setup repository for all the projects
to set up one or more projects do the following:

1. create a master folder that will contain all the projects
2. clone https://github.com/davidsi/configure.git to a sub folder called "configure"
3. make sure you have export DMS-ROOT=~/github set!
4. run init.sh, this will set up the correct NPM files for the main script
	a. YOU MUST RUN THIS FROM THE "ROOT", not the configure directory
	b. you may need to run as sudo
	c. you will need to change the attribs of init.sh to be an executable
5. run node ./configure/configure.js 
	a. you may need to run as sudo
	b. args: 
		--help
		--gitSync
		--gitStatus
		--npm

		-gitInfo user.name user.email
		
		<setup>

setup can be one or more of the following (from setup.json):
	'all'          	 : everything
	'arduino-all     : all the arduino repositories
	'big-red-button' : the big red button websocket server
	'boat-all'       : all arduino, hardware, ios and node repositories for the boat controller
	'boat-server'    : the server for the boat
	'chippy-soc'     : complete chippy ruxpin project
	'rov-all'	     : all the ROV project
	'rov-soc'        : just the node (chip) files for the ROV project
	'weather-all'    : node and arduino files for weather station 
	'weather-soc'    : just node (chip)  files for weather station 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
typically repositories names are 
	XXX-lib     : the library for the language
	XXX-arduino	: all the arduino code for the project as they tend to be built on the laptop
	XXX-ios	    : for ios apps
	XXX         : node code for SOC devices that only require their own code
                : should name these XXX-node

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the repositories are used as follows:
	'arduino-lib'     : arduino library functions
	'node-lib'		  : node library

	'boat-arduino'    : all arduino projects for the boat controller
	'boat-soc-common' : common code shared among one or more soc devices. Not used by all.
	'boat-ios'        : ios controller for boat controller
	'boat-server'     : the server for the boat, connects all devices, iOS, iKommunicate etc
						this also has various big red button utils, such as the music player
	'chippy'		  : chippy ruxpin node code
	'configure'       : master setup
	'gmail-example'   : for creating apps transmitting by mail, such as the qcyc fleet captain app
	'hardware'        : 3d print and scematics
	'rov-arduino'     : arduino section of the rov
	'rov-node'		  : node section of ROV - includes both controller and sub
	'weather-soc'     : the chip (node) code for the weather device

the following are archived
	chip-controller
	development     : this is the archive

each repository has an optional configure.json file which will be run when it is set up. In the case of the node based repo's, it will contain the list of NPM modules required.
